# NeuTomPy-toolbox
NeuTomPy-toolbox is a Python package for tomographic data processing and reconstruction.
The toolbox includes pre-processing algorithms, artifacts removal and a wide range of iterative
reconstruction methods as well as the Filtered Back Projection algorithm. 
The NeuTomPy toolbox was conceived primarily for Neutron Tomography (NT) and developed to support 
the need of users and researchers to compare state-of-the-art reconstruction methods and choose the optimal data-processing 
workflow for their data.

# Features
* Readers and writers for TIFF and FITS files and stack of images.
* Data normalization with dose correction, correction of the rotation axis tilt, ring-filters, outlier removals 
* A wide range of reconstruction algorithms powered by ASTRA toolbox: FBP, SIRT, SART, ART, CGLS, NN-FBP, MR-FBP
* Reconstruction evaluation with several image quality metrics
